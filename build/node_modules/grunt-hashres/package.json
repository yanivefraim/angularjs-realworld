  "readme": "#### grunt-hashres has been updated to Grunt 0.4. if you're still using Grunt 0.3.x go to [old version documentation](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/blob/master/grunt-0.3-README.md)\n\n# grunt-hashres\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Luismahou/grunt-hashres.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Luismahou/grunt-hashres)\n\nHashes your js and css files and rename the ```<script>``` and ```<link>``` declarations that refer to them in your html/php/etc files.\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall this grunt plugin next to your project's [Gruntfile.js][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-hashres`\n\nThen add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-hashres');\n```\n\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[getting_started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md\n\n## Documentation\nAdd the following to your ```Gruntfile.js``` file, inside the ```initConfig``` function:\n\n```js\nhashres: {\n  // Global options\n  options: {\n    // Optional. Encoding used to read/write files. Default value 'utf8'\n    encoding: 'utf8',\n    // Optional. Format used to name the files specified in 'files' property.\n    // Default value: '${hash}.${name}.cache.${ext}'\n    fileNameFormat: '${hash}.${name}.cache.${ext}',\n    // Optional. Should files be renamed or only alter the references to the files\n    // Use it with '${name}.${ext}?${hash} to get perfect caching without renaming your files\n    // Default value: true\n    renameFiles: true\n  },\n  // hashres is a multitask. Here 'prod' is the name of the subtask. You can have as many as you want.\n  prod: {\n    // Specific options, override the global ones\n    options: {\n      // You can override encoding, fileNameFormat or renameFiles\n    },\n    // Files to hash\n    src: [\n      // WARNING: These files will be renamed!\n      'dist/prod/scripts/my-compressed-and-minified-scripts.js',\n      'dist/prod/styles/my-compressed-and-minified-styles.css'],\n    // File that refers to above files and needs to be updated with the hashed name\n    dest: 'dist/prod/home.php',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Recommended workflow\n```grunt-hashres```, as a general rule, should be run when you're going to release your code. Ideally, you should create a ```stage``` folder where you'll copy your ```html```, minified ```js``` and ```css``` and all your resources. And then, on this clean copy, hash the resource names.\n\n### Alternative workflow\nDue to popular demand, the task support to update references that where already hashed. This means, that you won't need to create a stage folder before running ```grunt-hashres```. See [#26](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/26) and [#29](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/29) for more info.\n\n### Heads up\nIf you have upgraded from Grunt 0.3 version: 'files' and 'out' config properties have been replaced by 'src' and 'dest'\n\n### Properties\n* ```src```: A single file expression or an array of file expressions.\nSomething like ```myscripts/*.js``` would be valid.\n* ```dest```: The file expression(s) that refer to the hashed files and that will be updated with the new names.\nYou can update more than one file specifying an array of output files: ```[out/fileOne.html, out/fileTwo.html]```\n* ```encoding```: Encoding used to read and write files. Using ```utf8``` by default.\n* ```fileNameFormat```: The files specified in property ```files``` will be renamed\naccording to the pattern specified in this property. The following variables are allowed:\n  * ```${hash}```: the first 8 digits of the md5 of the file.\n  * ```${name}```: the original name of the file.\n  * ```${ext}```: the original extension of the file.\n* ```renameFiles```: Rename the files or leave them in place and only alter the references to them in ```out```. Defaults to ```true```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\nAdd unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt][grunt].\n\n## Release History\n* 13/02/14 - 0.4.1: Bugfix [#32](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/pull/32): Now it works when you try to substitute ```bar.js``` and ```foobar.js``` in the same go. Thanks to [crodas](https://github.com/crodas)\n* 24/01/14 - 0.4.0: Due to popular demand (see [#26](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/26), [#29](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/29), and more) ```grunt-hashres``` now support to run multiple times the hashing without creating a clean copy of the files to hash. Thanks to [jrduncans](https://github.com/jrduncans) and [ajaybc](https://github.com/ajaybc) for their effort.\n* 17/11/14 - 0.3.4: Bugfix [#18](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/pull/18): Fixed special character test that doesn't work on windows.\n* 07/11/13 - 0.3.3: Bugfix [#16](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/pull/16): Renaming files with special characters. Thanks to [crodas](https://github.com/crodas).\n* 14/05/13 - 0.3.2: Bugfix [#8](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/pull/8): Replace all ocurrences.
